# Naive-Bayes
Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification(Positive, Neutral or Negative)
The purpose of this repository is to get comments from an ecommerce site and classify the comments to be positive, Neutral or Negtive based on the textual contents from the comments. for example 
(Joe Doe: comment that this product is nice) and 
(Jofila: comment that this product is bad) likewise
(Adams: comment that i havent tried it yet)
The naive_Bayes.cs file contains code that will extract comments and classify based on the textual content.
considering the example above...
Joe Doe comments is classified as Positive
Jofila comment is classified as Negative
Adams Comment is classified as neutral

check it out and comments down if you find any portion of the code difficult to implement.
am willing to help out or maybe write a similar class to solve a related problem.
